# HoneyHive Instrument

Wire HoneyHive tracing into a user's application with a small, surgical edit set: initialize the tracer, attach an instrumentor for their LLM/agent framework, and verify spans flush.

> **You are an instrumentation surgeon, not a rewriter.** The user has working code. Add tracing in the smallest number of edits possible. Never refactor unrelated code, never change framework versions, never strip features.

## Three phases only

This skill has exactly three phases. Each phase has a **checkpoint** — a concrete artifact that proves the phase ran. If you skip a phase, the checkpoint will be missing and the eval will catch it.

| Phase | Goal | Checkpoint |
|-------|------|------------|
| **Validate** | Confirm network + runtime before touching code | Curl returns HTTP 200 + runtime findings recorded |
| **Setup** | Add tracing wiring via the language-specific reference | Exactly one setup reference loaded + edits applied |
| **Verify** | Smoke run + grade against success.md | Session visible in HoneyHive + success.md loaded and graded |

## Phase 1 — Validate (deterministic, no user questions until stuck)

Validation is deterministic discovery. Run checks in order; stop on failure. Only ask the user when a check is ambiguous.

### Step 1.1 — Network validation

Load and follow [references/network-validation.md](../honeyhive-cli/references/network-validation.md).

Run the reachability check:

```bash
curl -sS -o /dev/null -w "HTTP %{http_code}\n" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $HH_API_KEY" \
  "${HH_DATA_PLANE_URL:-$HH_API_URL}/healthcheck"
```

**Checkpoint:** Curl returns HTTP 200. If not, stop with the exact error from the interpretation table below. Do not retry. Do not proceed.

| HTTP code | Cause | Recovery |
|-----------|-------|----------|
| 200 | Valid | Proceed |
| 401 | Key invalid for this deployment | Redirect user to project settings: https://app.us.honeyhive.ai/settings/project/keys |
| 403 | Key lacks project scope | Redirect user to project settings: https://app.us.honeyhive.ai/settings/project/keys |
| 404 | Wrong URL | Verify the deployment URL (`HH_DATA_PLANE_URL` for TS/CLI, `HH_API_URL` for Python), no trailing slash |
| 000 | Egress blocked | Surface URL + port to network team |

### Step 1.2 — Runtime validation

Load and follow [references/runtime-validation.md](references/runtime-validation.md).

This is a read-only scan. Do not edit any files. Detect:

1. **Subtree** — locate the LLM app in a monorepo (ask if ambiguous)
2. **Language + runtime** — from manifests (pyproject.toml, package.json, go.mod, etc.)
3. **Framework + version** — which LLM SDK is pinned
4. **Instrumentor family** — OpenInference vs Traceloop (Python only)
5. **Existing HH wiring** — grep for `HoneyHiveTracer.init` / `new Client(`
6. **Existing OTel provider** — grep for `TracerProvider` setups from other vendors

**Checkpoint:** All six findings recorded. The setup path (Python / TypeScript / native OTel) is determined.

### Step 1.3 — Confirm the path with the user

Present findings and the proposed setup path. Confirm before adding dependencies.

## Phase 2 — Setup (load exactly one language reference; follow it end-to-end)

Pick the path that matches runtime-validation findings. Load **exactly one** setup reference:

- **Python** — [references/python-setup.md](references/python-setup.md)
- **TypeScript** — [references/ts-setup.md](references/ts-setup.md)
- **Native OTel** (Go, Rust, Java, .NET, any bespoke OTel) — [references/otel-setup.md](references/otel-setup.md)

Each setup file consumes Phase 1's findings and has its own internal steps (dependency plan, init placement, session boundaries, distributed propagation, verification). Follow it end-to-end.

**Load additional references only when findings demand it:**
- `existing_otel_provider = real:<vendor>` → also load [references/co-existence.md](references/co-existence.md)
- `deployment_type = dedicated | self-host` → also load [references/dedicated-deployments.md](../honeyhive-cli/references/dedicated-deployments.md)

For frameworks with first-class docs coverage, also pull the framework's integration docs page for the exact install + minimal-integration block — copy verbatim, adapt to the user's entry-point:

- **Integrations index** — <https://docs.honeyhive.ai/v2/integrations> (find the user's framework here)
- **Tracing quickstart** — <https://docs.honeyhive.ai/v2/introduction/tracing-quickstart>
- **SDK reference** — <https://docs.honeyhive.ai/v2/sdk-reference> (Python, TypeScript, semconv)

**Checkpoint:** Setup reference loaded. Dependency changes proposed (not yet committed). Init placement, session boundaries, and propagation strategy decided.

If the user's framework isn't on the index above, follow the doc-gap protocol in Phase 3 step 3.

## Phase 3 — Verify

### Step 3.1 — Smoke run

Run the user's main entry-point with a one-line dummy prompt (if env vars are set). Confirm:
- Process exits 0
- No OTEL warnings (`No tracer provider has been initialized`, `Span context lost`)

### Step 3.2 — Mechanical trace check

Query for events using the events search endpoint:

```bash
curl -s -X POST "${HH_DATA_PLANE_URL:-$HH_API_URL}/v1/events/search" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $HH_API_KEY" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"project": "<project-name>", "filters": [{"field": "event_type", "operator": "is", "value": "session", "type": "string"}], "limit": 5}'
```

Find the most recent session, then search for its child events:

```bash
curl -s -X POST "${HH_DATA_PLANE_URL:-$HH_API_URL}/v1/events/search" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $HH_API_KEY" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"project": "<project-name>", "filters": [{"field": "session_id", "operator": "is", "value": "<session-id>", "type": "string"}], "limit": 50}'
```

Verify: at least one event exists, and at least one has `event_type: "model"` (LLM span). If zero events or no model events, go back to Phase 2.

### Step 3.3 — Grade against success criteria

Load [success.md](success.md) and grade the trace:

- **Trace structure** — are event names meaningful? are model events shallow (depth ≤ 2)? are tool calls linked to parent agent?
- **Input/output cleanliness** — does the session show the user's query? do LLM events show full message history + tools + response?
- **Semantic failures** — are errored events surfaced clearly, not buried in metadata?
- **Summarisability** — is there a final event with enough context for end-to-end evaluators?

If the trace is mechanically correct but qualitatively messy, circle back to Phase 2 and adjust session-boundary placement or instrumentor choice. **A mechanically-correct integration that produces a messy trace is not done.**

> **Auto-instrumentation may not capture everything important.** If the trace is missing key steps (e.g., retrieval, tool calls, orchestration logic), add manual spans and enrichments using the APIs from the setup reference loaded in Phase 2. Auto-instrumentation is the starting point, not the ceiling.

### Step 3.4 — Verify against MUSTs

Review the code changes against the Requirements (MUSTs) section below. Confirm no violations (hardcoded keys, dual tracer, global provider hijack, etc.).

### Step 3.5 — Doc-gap surfacing

If during discovery you found a framework, instrumentor, or OTel exporter combination not covered above, do **not** improvise. Tell the user: "I've flagged this as a doc gap; here's the working install I produced; please open an issue at <https://github.com/honeyhiveai/skills/issues> if you'd like first-class coverage."

**Checkpoint:** Session visible in HoneyHive with model events. success.md loaded and graded. Trace passes the rubric.

## Stop

Single-pass. Do not continue iterating after success criteria are met. Instrumentation is the only goal — once spans are flowing and the trace grades well, hand off to the user. Anything beyond (evaluating quality, improving prompts, tuning retrieval) is out of scope.

## References

Load only when the phase calls for them. Progressive disclosure keeps context tight.

**Peer files:**

- [success.md](success.md) — qualitative rubric for Phase 3 trace grading

**Phase 1 — Validation:**

- [references/network-validation.md](../honeyhive-cli/references/network-validation.md) — env var sourcing, curl reachability, status-code interpretation, TLS chain
- [references/runtime-validation.md](references/runtime-validation.md) — subtree, language, framework, instrumentor, existing wiring, existing provider

**Phase 2 — Setup (load exactly one):**

- [references/python-setup.md](references/python-setup.md) — Python path
- [references/ts-setup.md](references/ts-setup.md) — TypeScript path
- [references/otel-setup.md](references/otel-setup.md) — Native OTel path (any language)

**Operational (load when findings demand it):**

- [references/co-existence.md](references/co-existence.md) — sharing a TracerProvider with a non-HH vendor
- [references/dedicated-deployments.md](../honeyhive-cli/references/dedicated-deployments.md) — dedicated and self-host URL wiring
- [references/prod-gotchas.md](references/prod-gotchas.md) — production checklist (deps, threading, memory, certs, PII, sampling)

## Requirements (MUSTs)

These are hard rules. Violating any one is a skill failure that evaluators will catch.

- **MUST NOT proceed past Phase 1 without successful network validation.** Wrong URL or rejected key means every later step rebuilds sand.
- **MUST NOT globally register HoneyHive as the source-of-truth TracerProvider.** The SDK doesn't do this; instrumentation code must not either. Evaluator: `no-global-provider-hijack`.
- **MUST NOT construct two tracers (Python) or two Client instances (TS).** Reuse the existing instance. Evaluator: `no-dual-tracer-instances`.
- **MUST NOT hardcode API keys.** Always sourced from env vars. Evaluator: `no-hardcoded-api-keys`.
- **MUST NOT let the deployment URL silently fall back to the wrong host.** Confirm explicitly — the env var name varies by SDK (`HH_DATA_PLANE_URL` for TS/CLI, `HH_API_URL` for Python). Multi-tenant default is `https://api.dp1.us.honeyhive.ai`; dedicated and self-host customers have their own.
- **MUST NOT switch instrumentor families** (OpenInference ↔ Traceloop) without explicit user consent.
- **MUST NOT thread session_id through function signatures** (TS path). Use a module-level helper or async-context store.
- **MUST NOT bump SDK or framework versions** to make instrumentation work.
- **MUST NOT modify test files or lock files** unless the user explicitly asks.
- **MUST NOT run a production deploy step.** Local smoke run is the verification ceiling.
- **MUST load success.md at verification time** (Phase 3), not at the start.
- **MUST record runtime-validation findings** before loading a setup reference. The setup file consumes findings, it does not re-detect.
